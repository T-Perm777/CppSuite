# CppSuite - A Suite of Helpful C++ Tools
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and use these C++ tools.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (I used g++)
- (Optional) VSCode (or any other text editor, like Notepad++, Vim, or nano) to look through the files

### Building

- First, cd into the folder that has the .cpp files (like src\OSInfo, src\RandomPassGen, etc.)
- Then run the command `g++ *.exe -o filename.exe`. Replace filename with whatever you would like to name the executable.

#### **Optional, but rccommended**

- Add the file path (ie, C:\Tools\OSInfo) to your system's PATH.

## Usage

- For `OSInfo`, just type in the name of your compiled exe to run it. If you haven't added it to your PATH, first cd into the folder with the exe, then type .\*.exe, replacing * with the name of the exe.
- For RandomPassGen (also called PassGen), run the command, and follow the prompts on screen. To generate a password with default setting, run it with the -f flag. to output to a file, use the -o flag, followed by the file name (either something like password.txt or C:\Passwords\password.txt).


#### If there's a feature or tool that you would like to see, submit a pull request!
